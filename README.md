# hiatusMenu

Hello all! I will be updating this Github with planned changes, known bugs and channels for feedback/feature requests in regards to the Hiatus Menu - Now available in my public folder "dfg's contraptions". If you do not have a copy of my public folder, you can find a copy in "The Directory" or PM me in game/on discord dfgHiatus#7426.

ABOUT:
The Hiatus Menu is an SAO-themed Avatar UI that can be used to drive the functionality of avatar subsystems, toggle clothing, serve as a vanity and is easily customizable to meet the needs of its end user. 

INSTALLATION:
1) Parent menu under your centered root. 
2) Under the parent, modify the ValueUserOvveride<bool> to your user, and set the value to true
3) Delete Tutorial Visual, and have fun. Open and close the menu by gripping and flicking up/down
  
PLANNED FEATURES:
- Create one-click installation
- Map hierarchy of Menu to Github, for ease of access and customization
